# Markdown Static Site

Markdown Static Site is a small vanilla PHP script that lats you easily turn a bunch of [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) files into a static site.

## Installation

The markdown files go in the `files` folder.  
Edit the value of the `markdownFilesPath` key in `config.json` to use another folder name.

Edit the value of the `defaultPath` key in `config.json` to the path of the default file to be shown when no path is specified via the URL.

If you don't want to use URL rewriting, set the value of the `useModRewrite` to `false` key in `config.json` (and delete/edit the `.htaccess`).

## Usage

The url `root-domain-or-folder/welcome` will display the markdown file at `root-domain-or-folder/files/welcome.md`.  
The url `root-domain-or-folder/folder/welcome` will display the markdown file at `root-domain-or-folder/files/folder/welcome.md`.  

You may access any files in the `files` folder without extension, provided the extension is set in the array as value of the `rewriteExtension` key in `config.json` (default is `md`, `html` and `php`).  

Without url rewriting, just add `index.php?` in front of the file's path : `root-domain-or-folder/index.php?welcome`.
